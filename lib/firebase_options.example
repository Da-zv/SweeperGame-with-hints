// This is an example file. The actual firebase_options.dart file is
// required to run the application but should NOT be committed to version control.

// To generate the necessary `lib/firebase_options.dart` file, follow these steps:

// 1. **Install the FlutterFire CLI**
//    If you don't have it installed, run this command in your terminal:
//    `dart pub global activate flutterfire_cli`

// 2. **Log into Firebase**
//    Ensure you are logged into the correct Firebase account:
//    `firebase login`

// 3. **Configure the project**
//    From the root directory of this project, run the `configure` command.
//    This command will communicate with Firebase, identify the apps in your
//    project, and generate the `lib/firebase_options.dart` file for you.
//
//    `flutterfire configure`

// After completing these steps, the required file will be created, and your
// application will be correctly configured to connect with your Firebase project.
